- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marcelo Busana
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer

I started programming when I was 14 years old, teaching myself PERL without the assistance of formal classes or courses. Despite having limited resources at the time, I developed my logical skills and even won a gold medal in the Brazilian Olympic Games by the age of 18. From that point on, I continued to develop myself by taking courses, earning degrees, and becoming an expert in software engineering and development. I worked on increasingly complex projects and became proficient in a wide range of programming languages and tools.
