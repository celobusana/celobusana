- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marcelo Busana
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer

I began programming at the age of 14, teaching myself PERL without the aid of formal classes or courses. Despite the limited resources available to me at that time, I developed my logical skills and even won a gold medal in the Brazilian Olympic Games until 18 years old. From that point on, I continued to develop my self, taking courses, graduations and expertise as a software engineer and developer, working on increasingly complex projects and becoming proficient in a wide range of programming languages and tools.
